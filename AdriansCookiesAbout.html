    <p>Adrian's Cookies are awesome. So damn good. Seriously, just the greatest frickin cookies you've ever had.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The idea to found Adrian's Cookies came to Adrian at 2:37am on Sunday 1/3, as Adrian realized that he was never going to be able to finish the enormous batch of cookies he had just made.</p>
